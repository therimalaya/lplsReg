\title{Two - class classification using lpls with crossvalidation}
\usage{
lplsReg.cv(X1, X2, X3, npc.sel = 1:5, alphavek = seq(0, 1, by = 0.2),
  npc.ref = NULL, testlevel = 0.05, dreduce = F, colcent = c(T, T),
  rowcent = c(F, F), grandcent = c(F, F), folds, err.eval.type = "rate",
  cvreport = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X1}{A response vector or matrix for regression. For classification
this should be either a factor or a dummy coded 0/1 matrix with one column
per group.}

\item{X2}{Predictor matrix of size (n x p).}

\item{X3}{Background information matrix of size (m x p)}

\item{npc.sel}{A vector of component numbers to be tested in the initial
LPLS model based on all variables in the inner CV - loop.  Default is 1:5.}

\item{alphavek}{A vector of alpha - values to be tested in the initial LPLS
model based on all variables in the inner CV - loop.  Default is a single
value 0. See \code{lplsReg} for details on alpha.}

\item{npc.ref}{A vector of component numbers to be tested in the re - fitted
LPLS model based on selected variables in the inner CV - loop.  Default is
NULL which gives no refitting.}

\item{testlevel}{Testlevel for the jackknife testing of the variables.
Deafult is 0.05}

\item{dreduce}{Logical. Should variable selection on the columns of X3
(parallel to X2) also be applied to the rows of X3? This is logical only if
X3 is a (p x p) matrix expressing some dependency or simlarity between the
variables in X2,  hence,  in cases where both the rows and columns of X3
relate to the variables of X2.}

\item{colcent}{Logical vector of length referring to X2 and X3. Should
column centering be performed?}

\item{rowcent}{Logical vector of length referring to X2 and X3. Should row
centering be performed?}

\item{grandcent}{Logical vector of length referring to X2 and X3. Should
overall centering be performed?}

\item{folds}{A list of length \code{k} defining the sample numbers in each
fold of k - fold cross - validation.  May use \code{balanced.folds} to make the
segment list up front of the analysis.}

\item{err.eval.type}{The evaluation criterion for prediction/classification
performance. Either "rate" (total error rate),  "rmsep" (root mean square
error),  or "rmsep2" a modified rmsep where only predictions between 0 and 1
contribute to the error.  Predictions outside this range are considered as
perfect predictions.}

\item{cvreport}{Logical. Should an iteration report be printed on screen
during the computations?}
}
\value{
\item{X1hatmat}{An array holding predicted X1 - values for each number of
components (initial model and refitted) and alpha values.}
\item{folds }{The CV - segments used.}
\item{coefs.all}{An array holding all estimated
regression coefficients for all components (initial model) and alphavalues.}
\item{sdcoef }{The standard deviations of the regressions coefficients.}
\item{trueclass }{For clasification:True class of sample}
\item{pval }{The p - values from jackknife testing of each regression coefficient for all
levels of components and alpha.}
\item{apost }{For clasification:The posterior probability of each sample to
belong to each class in case of classification.}
\item{class }{For clasification:The predicted class of each
sample for all levels of components and alpha.}
\item{err }{The total error (as defined by argument \code{err.eval.type}
for all level of components and alpha.}
\item{sigvars}{An array of logicals defining wether a variable is
found to be significant or not. Significance is given for all levels of
components and alpha, }
